# Project Title:
Bad Bank with Mongo & Docker

# Description/Motivation:
This weeks focus was building upon our last project in 
connecting the front end of bad bank to a Mongo DB document database, using Docker.  
It was then tested by using Studio 3T


# Installation Guidelines:

2.) Install, setup & launch docker<br>
3.) Download, install & launch Studio 3T<br>
4.) Run npm install to install all dependencies<br>
5.) Run docker run -p 27017:27017 --name badbank -d mongo<br>
6.) run node index.js<br>
7.) This will launch your localhost:3000 port.  <br>
8.) In Studio 3t click -create a connection<br>
9.) Use localhost:3000 for your connection point.<br>
10) run node index.js<br>
11.) Click on Create Account<br>
12.) Signup as a new user<br>
13.) Add in another user just to have more data to view in the db.<br>
14.) go back to Studio T and either refresh or disconnect and reconnect from the database and then you will be able to see the <br>
newly added users under collection/users.<br>
